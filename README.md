# Web-Services-and-APIs
this is the second project in my udacity Nanodegree journey (java web Devoleper).

here i made Eureka server and connected the other services to it , Pricing-service is microservice with Spring Data REST without the need to explicitly include code for the Controller or Service, PI documentation for the Vehicles API is implemented using Swagger, and all related API queries are able to be run from there. The documentation is available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html when the application is running.

please run eureka-server first , all the other web services are linked to this server , and then run the other three applications

technologies used:
Eureka Server and client,
Swagger,
Mockito in testing,
WebClient.
